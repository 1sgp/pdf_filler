## Technology used
- Flask (For the providing Website)
- Openai (For writing the summaries)
- Selenium with Firefox (For scraping the Homeoffice and Klassenbuecher Data)
- BeautifulSoup 

This is only for improve in coding and cause we're lazy to write this shitty forms.

## Start using Docker
Copy the .env file and edit the variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
and then run it
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env up --build -d
```

## Known Bugs?
- PDF's only looks fine in chrome. Firefox okay but looks ugly. Acrobat only shows text if you click on it.

### Todo
Look at projects page but a little list
- [x] Login Form 
- [ ] User Interface
- [ ] Add own notes to different berichtshefte
- [ ] Option to recreate the AI completion if not satisfied
- [x] Login into your moodle to see HOMEOFFICE Calculator (@1sqp)
- [ ] make readme pretty x3
