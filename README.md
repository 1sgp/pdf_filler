## Technology used
- Flask (For the providing Website)
- Openai (For writing the summaries)
- Selenium with Firefox (For scraping the Homeoffice and Klassenbuecher Data)
- BeautifulSoup 

This is only for improve in coding and cause we're lazy to write this shitty forms.

## Known Bugs?
- PDF's only looks fine in chrome. Firefox okay but looks ugly. Acrobat only shows text if you click on it.
